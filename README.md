# Diagonal-Difference
Calculate the difference of the main 2 diagonals 

Question:

  Given a square matrix, calculate the absolute difference between the sums of its diagonals.
  
  Ex: 
      1 2 3
      4 5 6
      9 8 9 
      
      Sum of left to right diagonal = 1+5+9 = 15
      Sum of right to left diagonal = 3+5+9 = 17
      
      Answer = |15 - 17| = 2
